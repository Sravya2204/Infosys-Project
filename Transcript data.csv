In today's video we are going explore 3 different use cases of UI action.
Each and every use case is very important to practice in the PDI.

I will explain each and every use case and also I will show you all the steps that I will perform to solve these use cases.
Make sure you watch the full video to understand each and every use case.
Also very importantly I will show how you can call server side action from client side UI action using gsftSubmit().

If you want to have the basic understanding of UI Action, please refer to my below video -
