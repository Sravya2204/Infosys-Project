think thats really stupid what i think is like you should do things that make you uncomfortable because you know they provide value for the thing that you want to accomplish and having like reaching out coldly asking to talk to people that may be awkward lets not pretend its not it may be a challenge lets not pretend its not lets acknowledge that but also just know those are the types of things especially in where we are right now that youre going to have to do to give yourself the best opportunity to get to that milestone which is a next role its a first role as a developer its a first role in tech its a salary that youve never had before its time off in vacation that youve never had before its the ability to prioritize work life balance that youve had before like welcome back to the

longtime fan of yours and i think we published one of your talks on freeo camp and it was like very popular it was like i have no idea what im doing i think it it showed your confused confused face in the uh thumbnail so so a lot of people may recognize you from that or they may recognize you from compressed fm which is an excellent podcast that youve done like 170 plus episodes i think uh but but youre and if theyve attended any technical conference theres a good chance they probably seen one of your talks yeah yeah theres its kind of funny listing all the different activities i dont know i this is something well definitely be able to dive into but theres so many different ways to be involved in the community so many ways to give back and then also theres selfish reasons for those that can help benefit you in your career which i think is going to be one of our talking points as well absolutely yeah and uh i think that one of the main things i hope that people get out uh of this other than an appreciation for everything that james is doing for the developer community is that there are lots of paths and there are still lots of opportunities it may be harder to get a job as a developer now that a lot of developers have been laid off and are like more midcareer people are competing for a lot of the roles that uh people fresh into the field are competing for like theres just more like a higher level of competition but uh its certainly possible and there are you know the jobs have largely come back uh its just that its its going to be a challenge and then combine that with the rising tide of like sentiment ill say about like ai being able to partially replace what developers do and things like that tools are always improving and theres always that water line thats climbing and you always have to climb a little higher so maybe we can start by just talking a little bit about what how you perceive the job market currently here as were recording this november 13th 2024 yeah i i feel like its its harder than its been in a long time to be honest there was kind of like i guess maybe early covid there was like kind of the golden age of of boot camps where its like people were spending more time at home they they kind of wanted something to dive into and people i think were just looking more into career changes and boot camps really exploded i think and you you saw so many success stories of people completely changing the trajectory of their career and i taught um one inperson round and one virtual round of a boot camp in uh 2019 and then 2021 i think and i think theres no better place to be i think like being a developer being in tech in general like the the benefits the salary the time off the culture especially as you work towards like younger companies i think its all really amazing but i think right now its its tougher than it ever or its tougher than it has been in in several years at least like as far as ive seen and so i think were seeing people graduating from boot camps and theyre having a harder time finding a job were seeing people self teaching and having a harder time finding a job were seeing people either get laid off or looking for their next role and having a harder time finding that next job and the one the one thing i do know is like just like blindly applying just like going to linkedin and seeing a job and clicking apply that it just doesnt work anymore like if if you find a job and get hired that way i would consider yourself extremely lucky i think so much of it comes from a couple of different aspects its like having things out there that are um validators of who you are and what you know and im biased but like content and speaking is a is a big validator for me you think about like words on a resume hey if i say i can communicate well thats just a word that everybody puts like good communicator right like thats just a its just a random word you put on a resume but if you can actually see me speak and especially speak on technical topics like i think that is a validator to what that thing actually means so i think the like building up your validators of like who you are and what you know and and what you can provide to a company and then also i hate i hate the word but its the its the best thing we have networking like i think its cliche and i think networking is often used to be like cold and sterile so i like to say networking is just investing in your community its showing up in your community its participating in the community its showing up to conferences its watching peoples content its commenting on peoples content its helping answer peoples questions on twitter x or whatever you want to call it i think just show showing up and being a part of the community is huge because every job that ive gotten basically has had some some impact with me knowing somebody at that company has been a significant indicator for me in my career and for everyone that i work with and and see those are the types of connections that make the difference between finding that next role and really really struggling too yeah and would you say the importance of who you know has increased uh after the layoffs like do you think that its more about uh having a strong network as you said uh networking like having invested a whole lot in your community mhm 100 i like i i i hear stories just over and over again of like you know ive apply to 100 jobs and never hear anything back i apply to jobs and get ghosted and i actually shared i spoke at render atl this summer and shared kind of a a similar story of uh just kind of talking about careers and how to be more prepared to get highed and i talked about even for me like ive got tons of connections and ive gotten ghosted on job opportunities and ive had an interview and never heard back like these are things that just happen every day and it really really sucks so i think those sort of connections like it its just hard to get in at all if you dont have at least something and for people who like dont have the background of like ive been to you know a 100 conferences or whatever for people who dont have that background you can also just start creating those relationships you can do you can message people on linkedin and say hey like i see you have a cool job would you would you do a coffee chat with me and just tell me about what you do and the company you work for and and if you then applied for a job at that company and you told that person hey like i really enjoy the conversation what you said about what you do and the culture at your company that sounded really interesting and that resonated with me if you tell them that and then tell them that you applied theres a chance that they go and say like oh like i got to talk to this person on the phone and it was a reasonable person who seemed like they may be a good fit for a team like they could pass it on to a hiring manager and its not like that in that five 10 15 minute conversation theyre going to really go to bat for you but you may be somebody who gets an interview because of having had that conversation because they can they can at least say you were competent enough to have the conversation and i think that that just goes so much farther than you imagine because otherwise theyre just looking at a bunch of rums and filtering out people automatically and then its just overwhelming to have so many resums even after being filtered too to to decide on like whos worth talking to so yes i would say like in my career its more important now more than ever uh your connections and your network yeah and uh what would you say to somebody who is in the process of learning to code their their self teaching and theyre just doing like you know an hour a day in the morning before they go to their day job you know driving a truck or um you know working at a hotel or something like that or or maybe they are have a a a job that they can actually apply their degree if they have a degree maybe theyre working as an accountant or something like that but they aspire to become a developer but they consider themselves to be more introverted like what would you say to somebody like that who is uh kind of like not relishing the notion of reaching out to people blindly not not blind but cold cold reach out outreach on linkedin like how would you hype that person up and and reassure them that uh it will be worth the uh discomfort yeah yeah thats thats a really good question and and for what its worth i consider myself to be extroverted but its really interesting how many people in similar careers as mine and i i mean people that are speaking on stage people that are running communities people that are reaching out blindly people that sit down at a table full of strangers and introduce themselves at conferences its really interesting to me how many people ive seen in those situations that consider themselves to be introverts and theres one that stands out out to or a couple that stand out to me specifically taylor dusen is a recruiter hes not technical but goes to technical conferences because hes a recruiter for developers and and i remember the first time meeting him he like he was social all day long and then at like 430 he was like okay im going to bed im not going to dinner im not going to after party im not going anywhere else like this is it and i was like dude youve been like youre the most social person i know how are you doing how are you like missing out on all this time and he was like no im actually very introverted and that just ex exhausted me and i need to go and be by myself and i think the the point of that was like he hes able to get out of it like he enjoys spending time with people enjoys talking to people still introverted but he he recognizes the impact thats going to have and he puts in that work to do that but then also has to recognize his limits of like what hes capable of and whats going to like push him to the point of exhaustion and to protect himself as well another example that ive always thought about is when i was at microsoft we had like a big training for our organization of 100 people or something and this guy was kind of leading this workshop a dayong workshop where he was on stage and he was leading us through activities and he was telling jokes and blah blah blah and he was one of the best speakers ive ever seen and he went through this whole thing of like like no im im super introverted when i get on stage i take on a persona that is not me and im able to flip that switch and kind of disassociate who i really am with who i am on stage so that i can do this job and so theres a couple different perspectives i can share with people i think one is kind of the tough love perspective like i understand the things im saying may be more difficult for you than they are for me totally understand that youre a different person different personality different things drain you in different ways totally understand lets accept that lets acknowledge that but lets also acknowledge that like hey if this is something youre serious about there are some things that you have to do that are going to make you uncomfortable and theres a a really cliche saying of like do things that make you uncomfortable and i think thats really stupid what i think is like you should do things that make you uncomfortable because you know they provide value for the thing that you want to accomplish and having like reaching out coldly asking to talk to people that may be awkward lets not pretend its not it may be a challenge lets not pretend its not lets acknowledge that but also just know those are the types of things especially in where we are right now that youre going to have to do to give yourself the best opportunity to get to that milestone which is a next role its a first role as a developer its a first role in tech its a salary that youve never had before its time off in vacation that youve never had before its the ability to prioritize work life balance that youve had before like remember what the longterm goal is and realize like even though doing some of the things that im talking about that other people will tell you they may be a challenge but they are a challenge thats worth it if you can get to that end goal that youre looking for 100 im like taking so many notes here because i i think that you really just encapsulated why its a struggle and like why so many people do persist in learning the code like i always tell people if you want a career where you can potentially you know have some degree of control in your life the boss is not calling you in to work the drivethru at 2 am like i used to get called in taco bell where its like till am so sometimes like somebody gets sick and youre like all right im going to go deal with all the stoners in the drivethru for like two hours right for like five five bucks an hour which is what i was paid back then uh in the in the late 90s when i was doing that uh you know like if you want to actually have agency in your life and if you want to be able to go in and have like negotiating power when youre talking with a hiring manager or the ability to switch companies fluidly and not feel all that fear there is a great deal of investment upfront and its investment in your career and in your skills that doesnt immediately have any payoff like what is the benefit of getting halfway to being a professional developer well you have a lot of cool stuff that you can do and you have like cool hobby and you probably expanded your mind in all kinds of ways that you wouldnt have had you not tried to learn to code and learn data structures algorithms computer science concepts things like that but the real prize at the end of the rainbow the real pot of gold maybe thats a bad analogy because i think in theory like theres not actually a a pot of gold at the end of rainbows like i havent ever like followed a rainbow all the way to the end of it no im just joking im pretty sure thats not physically possible that but um but like for a lot of people that pot of gold is you know why they even got into it right like they dont really care that much about programming a technology they may not even care that much about rebuilding their mind to be able to mimic that of a computer because you have to kind of mimic a computer because youre communicating with computers thats what programming is its telling a computer what to do in terms that it can understand there are a lot of people out there who just want to go out and get a highpaying job and be able to um you know switch jobs if their if their boss is harassing them or switch jobs if they uh their boss suddenly is like hey youve got to come back into the office you got to move halfway across the country you know to our to our hq uh because we sp spent a bunch of money on this real estate and were not using it for anything right um you know you you want to be able to have some degree of control and agency in your life right and and like frankly money gives you a lot of optionality because youre not necessarily like living paycheck to paycheck and youre like a car breakdown away from going into credit card debt right um what would you say to people who dont really care that much about the technology but do want to have that lifestyle that that freedom associated with working as a developer yeah i think i think thats a great question um i think theres theres been this conversation in the community and kind of a debate about the idea of passion like should you should you be passionate um or should you be required to be passionate and i think a lot of people say no because they interpret somebody looking to hire someone thats passionate as someone thats going to work 60 70 80 hours a week like theyre going to put in extra work because theyre passionate and that aside like if thats a perspective thats something i would want to shy away from i wouldnt want someone to hire me because they want me to work 80 hours a week work life balance is incredibly important for me but i think i think passion and excitement about what im doing is very important for me in my life and that is not at a sacrifice of money because i also want to make good money and i also want to have vacation and work life balance and those sort of things i think its just something that goes along with that and so the idea of like someone getting into tech because they want to make good money like theres other reasons too like overall comp and and all the things that you said but if we just look at um good money theres nothing inherently wrong with that just for me to fill the most fulf build i want that to also be associated with something im excited about and the cool thing about i i would say not just programming but like being in tech is i think its its more and more reasonable to combine those things like theres more and more opportunities to find something specific that you actually enjoy and get excited about that also makes really good money and thats just for me like i dont want to wake up every day its not worth the sacrifice to make more money and do something that i hate i want to make still good money and maybe a little bit less but still really good money to do something that i also enjoy because i i think the overall balance of those two is what im looking for but getting into like again just broadly tech is such a game cher for people especially like if if you havent been able to make near the amount of money if you havent seen a modern work culture if you havent seen like respected time off just uh you know like money i think is the easy thing i think for me uh kind of the respect the career opportunities like after you get your foot in the door theres kind of no limit to what you can do and where you can go um again work life talents vacation all the things that come along with it i think especially if you find the right place are uh just just amazing and i i share this story a lot my wife had worked in hospitality for years and i think she she was always really good at what she did she was always respected for what she did but its just very different culturally and uh so she ended up moving to oiro which is we over laughed at alero for two months and shes still there doing events and sponsorships but um she now i mean makes two or three times what she ever made in her career in the past and has a limited vacation gets to travel across the world has a team that she loves working with and its just amazing i think shes the perfect example for someone who like was super talented did a really good job was respected like reasonably for the culture and environment she was in but that level of of respect and and what that means for her now is just completely different and that nothing makes me happier than for her to be in a position where she feels proud of what she does respected for what she does well compensated for what she does and i think thats the kind of opportunity thats out there for anyone thats looking to get into yeah and and i will say like there are a lot of kind of like hills that you can climb and theres this thing this notion of like a hill climbing algorithm and you may have reached like a local maxima right where youre like on top of a hill but if you can look at and you can see higher hills its a lot of work to go down the hill and climb new hill like im sure it wasnt easy for your wife to transition from working in just like more broad hospitality to working doing events at a tech company but uh you know it sounds like she did go down the hill and she figured out a way to climb up a much higher hill and now shes up there and i think that a lot of people uh certainly some people who are listening to this who feel like theyre doing all right you can always do better but a lot of times it takes going down and it takes the notion of like becoming a beginner again in some aspect or or you know rebuilding your network in a different industry or something like that and that can be daunting uh but from what like all the people ive talked to its almost always worth it like very worst case scenario like when i when i was getting when i was learning the code i was already working as a school director so and you know i been to grad school and like i was coming from a position of relative privilege in terms of just having a broad array of knowledge worker type jobs i could do and i knew that i knew i could always kind of go back to directing schools if i scrubbed out if i just wasnt like good enough at coding uh and to some extent that kind of handicapped me a little bit uh early on because i was like you know im already good at this i would tell myself oh im really good at speaking chinese im really good at like you know running running a school im really good at doing paperwork and like managing a team of teachers and stuff like that like i can always go back to that uh and to some extent that like that did make me feel like i was um you know that it wasnt necessary for me to really perform with this and and that this was just like some kind of like crazy uh ideal like this this was a was was a good term for it this was kind of like a romp this was like uh a spous journey into code and i was going to come around and all all my family would be relieved that i went back into the respectful job of you know running a school but uh youre if youre listening to this you may have some skill set you may already be thinking like well im doing all right here uh but you know i think i think your wife is a good example of of theres always a higher hill that you can climb if you look around and if youre willing to put in the time and energy uh so i i hope you all take to heart what james is saying here because for me like it totally rings true like i think there there are always plateaus everybody has plateaus in their life i could have in theory just stay taco bell there was a guy that worked at taco bell named duke who was like really old and and haggard and hes probably about the same age that i am now but he looked like he was like 70 or something and he just building burritos for like 20 plus years and uh and dealing with like you know stone customers and stuff like that and you know like that is a local maxima like like i might have been a promoted the store manager or something eventually right like he was he was like a you know store manager and stuff but just i encourage you all however uh comfortable you may be in your position assuming youre comfortable a lot of people listening to this probably arent comfortable at all a lot of people maybe trying to figure out how theyre going to pay rent next month you know know or or a lot of people you know may be sleeping in their cars i slept in my car for like a year when i left when i dropped out of high school and just like you know was spent all my days at the library and stuff like that and and i wasnt sure what the future held i wasnt even sure if i had a future but uh there is always a hill somewhere that is probably within v visual range that you can see like hey if i climbed up to that hill i would be higher like lets go try to climb that hill and then when you get to higher you see the other high points and and its just hills all the way out right theres always a higher point that you can reach right absolutely and i think the the this is one of the number one pieces of career advice i have for people is to do your research and so if you if you kind of think about what you just said of like oh maybe there is a hill that people have seen or not the reality is like youre probably not going to see that hill if you dont put some intentional effort into finding it and and what that means in this scenario is having those conversations with people like if im throwing out random numbers this is doesnt mean anything but if if you make 40000 a year and you feel pretty comfortable and then all of a sudden at a dinner party you meet somebody whos a developer and they make 150000 a year you may now be interested in what its like to be a developer versus the job that youre in whatever that is and then and then the way that escalates is then you have the deeper conversation to find out like well how long have you been in your career um what did you do to get there what did that look like what did a first job look like and as you start to do your research you can find out out what reasonable hills there are to climb and what reasonable plateaus are at different stages and then how to potentially go from from one to the other but i think you have to you have to spend some time really kind of looking and asking questions having conversation doing your research and figuring out what those opportunities are because you can and again i go back to my wife like super super talented did a great job but just in the industry she was in just had this this cap of what she was capable of of being compensated and and all these things and so i ive been really fortunate i think in my career and and life of being around people that are super super talented and super super smart and and super motivated and i i go back to like my best friend through high school still my best friend today um this is annoying but hes one of the smartest people ive ever known he his backup school was my like dream school and he got accepted into every ivy league school just the smartest person ive ever met and and that can be really frustrating for me at times but also i just see him do things that i never would have thought of as possible and when i worked at microsoft especially fresh out of college and in my first job professional job i was working with startups and students from other universities and just developers in the community and seeing the things they were doing i never imagined that those things were possible but after you start to see them as a reality as a possibility for someone else you start to kind of wonder what is that what does that potential look like for me and then more strategically what sort of research what sort of conversations what sort of questions can i ask to figure out how do i get there yeah 100 and one of the things that uh i think theres a lot of negativity out there a lot of people are going to potentially be watching this and saying like oh so pull yourself up by your bootstraps is what youre saying like like just uh thats a frequent comment that uh people will leave on on these podcasts for example uh because a lot of people uh have its easy for you and i to say from this position of relative success uh like youll make it uh but im here to say you wont necessarily make it not everybodys going to make it a lot of people arent going to make it theyre going to scrub out uh and i just as easily could have scrubbed out i quit programming several times uh right everybody probably quits at some point gets frustrated they cant get it and they just take a few days off and then eventually that like cooler heads prevail and maybe they come back maybe they dont maybe theyre just like oh im going to go take this real estate you know realtor license or something and go that route or um one of the many other careers that you can do other than software development uh but um like there is a lot of negative it out there and a lot of people are probably hearing uh things like its doomed its over you know theres like ai is just going to take all our jobs uh what would you say to somebody who is kind of like a a developer doomer if you will and they they think that like now the industry is over and theres theres no way in yeah i mean i i definitely dont agree with the idea of the industry is over and theres nowh no way in i think the reality is its more difficult to to break in than it was 5 years ago i think we should all be honest about that and i again we go back to layoffs like when you hear about layoffs of big companies happening every month that means theres that many more people already in their careers that are looking for their next role as well so the competition gets tighter salaries go down like i im making less than i made in my fulltime roll at planet scale two years two and a half years ago a little bit less and that was an expectation that just doing my research i had and i expected because thats just how it is its like the the the idea of doom no i dont i dont think were out of jobs i dont think ai is taking jobs like were using ai all the time theres this interesting i think its called devons paradox they give a talk about like the impact on um the ai is having on developers developer expi de ai being a tool that was you know deceptively good at uh doing basic quests right like like they raled that ultimately wasnt nearly as good as the marketing uh said and they used a lot of trickery uh but but i just want to fill people in what devon is devon ai is was i dont know it was some effort to essentially replace uh sell this tool to a company like hey you dont need as many developers look this will this will be your junior developer and all that stuff uh so please go on i just wanted to give people some context in what devon is yeah thats thats actually great context i actually mi misspoke because what i was referring to is jeevans paradox which is obviously sounds somewh but but the idea is like people people look at ai and they say like okay if ai can do these basic things way faster than me the fear is like i get replaced right for those things but but jeevans paradox is the idea that like okay if ai can do these things for us well then then were now capable of doing so much more maybe now we have time to tackle problems that we didnt have time to tackle before because we had to do some of the things that now ai takes on for us so i think you can look at it in two ways you can be fearful of it taking my job and i really dont think that thats been the case i think its been a tool that developers have adopted and adapted to using and i think theyre growing more and more popular every day but i dont think theyre replacing developers but theres the jevans paradox which is li,how to get a developer job even in this economy with james q quick podcast 153 . do things that make you uncomfortable and i think thats really stupid what i think is like you should do things that make you uncomfortable because you know they provide value for the thing that you want to accomplish and having like reaching out coldly asking to talk to people that may be awkward lets not pretend its not it may be a challenge lets not pretend its not lets acknowledge that but also just know those are the types of things especially in where we are right now that youre going to have to do to give yourself the best opportunity to get to that milestone which is a next role its a first role as a developer its a first role in tech its a salary that youve never had before its time off in vacation that youve never had before its the ability to prioritize work life balance that youve had before like welcome back to the freec cod camp podcast your source for raw unedited interviews with devs this weeks episode how to get a developer job even in this economy with james qqu this weeks musical intro with your truly on the guitar drums bass and keys the 1987 arcade classic shinobi n welcome back to the fre cod camp podcast im quincy larson teacher and founder of freecodecamporg each week were bring you insight from developers founders and ambitious people in tech this week were talking with james qqu hes a developer speaker and teacher james grew up in memphis he was an athlete who played violin and knew nothing about computer science but chose it as his college major since then hes not only worked as a dev at microsoft and fedex and a whole lot of other startups but hes also given more than 100 talks at conferences about technical topics uh james its great to have you here man and hey hey super excited to be here longtime fan yeah and uh support for this podcast comes from a grant from wix studio wick studio provides developers tools to rapidly build websites with everything out of the box that ext extend replace and break boundaries with code learn more at wix studiocom support also comes from the 11043 kind folks who support free c camp through a monthly donation join these kind folks and help our mission at donate freo camporg right its its a thrill to have you here man uh im a longtime fan of yours and i think we published one of your talks on freeo camp and it was like very popular it was like i have no idea what im doing i think it it showed your confused confused face in the uh thumbnail so so a lot of people may recognize you from that or they may recognize you from compressed fm which is an excellent podcast that youve done like 170 plus episodes i think uh but but youre and if theyve attended any technical conference theres a good chance they probably seen one of your talks yeah yeah theres its kind of funny listing all the different activities i dont know i this is something well definitely be able to dive into but theres so many different ways to be involved in the community so many ways to give back and then also theres selfish reasons for those that can help benefit you in your career which i think is going to be one of our talking points as well absolutely yeah and uh i think that one of the main things i hope that people get out uh of this other than an appreciation for everything that james is doing for the developer community is that there are lots of paths and there are still lots of opportunities it may be harder to get a job as a developer now that a lot of developers have been laid off and are like more midcareer people are competing for a lot of the roles that uh people fresh into the field are competing for like theres just more like a higher level of competition but uh its certainly possible and there are you know the jobs have largely come back uh its just that its its going to be a challenge and then combine that with the rising tide of like sentiment ill say about like ai being able to partially replace what developers do and things like that tools are always improving and theres always that water line thats climbing and you always have to climb a little higher so maybe we can start by just talking a little bit about what how you perceive the job market currently here as were recording this november 13th 2024 yeah i i feel like its its harder than its been in a long time to be honest there was kind of like i guess maybe early covid there was like kind of the golden age of of boot camps where its like people were spending more time at home they they kind of wanted something to dive into and people i think were just looking more into career changes and boot camps really exploded i think and you you saw so many success stories of people completely changing the trajectory of their career and i taught um one inperson round and one virtual round of a boot camp in uh 2019 and then 2021 i think and i think theres no better place to be i think like being a developer being in tech in general like the the benefits the salary the time off the culture especially as you work towards like younger companies i think its all really amazing but i think right now its its tougher than it ever or its tougher than it has been in in several years at least like as far as ive seen and so i think were seeing people graduating from boot camps and theyre having a harder time finding a job were seeing people self teaching and having a harder time finding a job were seeing people either get laid off or looking for their next role and having a harder time finding that next job and the one the one thing i do know is like just like blindly applying just like going to linkedin and seeing a job and clicking apply that it just doesnt work anymore like if if you find a job and get hired that way i would consider yourself extremely lucky i think so much of it comes from a couple of different aspects its like having things out there that are um validators of who you are and what you know and im biased but like content and speaking is a is a big validator for me you think about like words on a resume hey if i say i can communicate well thats just a word that everybody puts like good communicator right like thats just a its just a random word you put on a resume but if you can actually see me speak and especially speak on technical topics like i think that is a validator to what that thing actually means so i think the like building up your validators of like who you are and what you know and and what you can provide to a company and then also i hate i hate the word but its the its the best thing we have networking like i think its cliche and i think networking is often used to be like cold and sterile so i like to say networking is just investing in your community its showing up in your community its participating in the community its showing up to conferences its watching peoples content its commenting on peoples content its helping answer peoples questions on twitter x or whatever you want to call it i think just show showing up and being a part of the community is huge because every job that ive gotten basically has had some some impact with me knowing somebody at that company has been a significant indicator for me in my career and for everyone that i work with and and see those are the types of connections that make the difference between finding that next role and really really struggling too yeah and would you say the importance of who you know has increased uh after the layoffs like do you think that its more about uh having a strong network as you said uh networking like having invested a whole lot in your community mhm 100 i like i i i hear stories just over and over again of like you know ive apply to 100 jobs and never hear anything back i apply to jobs and get ghosted and i actually shared i spoke at render atl this summer and shared kind of a a similar story of uh just kind of talking about careers and how to be more prepared to get highed and i talked about even for me like ive got tons of connections and ive gotten ghosted on job opportunities and ive had an interview and never heard back like these are things that just happen every day and it really really sucks so i think those sort of connections like it its just hard to get in at all if you dont have at least something and for people who like dont have the background of like ive been to you know a 100 conferences or whatever for people who dont have that background you can also just start creating those relationships you can do you can message people on linkedin and say hey like i see you have a cool job would you would you do a coffee chat with me and just tell me about what you do and the company you work for and and if you then applied for a job at that company and you told that person hey like i really enjoy the conversation what you said about what you do and the culture at your company that sounded really interesting and that resonated with me if you tell them that and then tell them that you applied theres a chance that they go and say like oh like i got to talk to this person on the phone and it was a reasonable person who seemed like they may be a good fit for a team like they could pass it on to a hiring manager and its not like that in that five 10 15 minute conversation theyre going to really go to bat for you but you may be somebody who gets an interview because of having had that conversation because they can they can at least say you were competent enough to have the conversation and i think that that just goes so much farther than you imagine because otherwise theyre just looking at a bunch of rums and filtering out people automatically and then its just overwhelming to have so many resums even after being filtered too to to decide on like whos worth talking to so yes i would say like in my career its more important now more than ever uh your connections and your network yeah and uh what would you say to somebody who is in the process of learning to code their their self teaching and theyre just doing like you know an hour a day in the morning before they go to their day job you know driving a truck or um you know working at a hotel or something like that or or maybe they are have a a a job that they can actually apply their degree if they have a degree maybe theyre working as an accountant or something like that but they aspire to become a developer but they consider themselves to be more introverted like what would you say to somebody like that who is uh kind of like not relishing the notion of reaching out to people blindly not not blind but cold cold reach out outreach on linkedin like how would you hype that person up and and reassure them that uh it will be worth the uh discomfort yeah yeah thats thats a really good question and and for what its worth i consider myself to be extroverted but its really interesting how many people in similar careers as mine and i i mean people that are speaking on stage people that are running communities people that are reaching out blindly people that sit down at a table full of strangers and introduce themselves at conferences its really interesting to me how many people ive seen in those situations that consider themselves to be introverts and theres one that stands out out to or a couple that stand out to me specifically taylor dusen is a recruiter hes not technical but goes to technical conferences because hes a recruiter for developers and and i remember the first time meeting him he like he was social all day long and then at like 430 he was like okay im going to bed im not going to dinner im not going to after party im not going anywhere else like this is it and i was like dude youve been like youre the most social person i know how are you doing how are you like missing out on all this time and he was like no im actually very introverted and that just ex exhausted me and i need to go and be by myself and i think the the point of that was like he hes able to get out of it like he enjoys spending time with people enjoys talking to people still introverted but he he recognizes the impact thats going to have and he puts in that work to do that but then also has to recognize his limits of like what hes capable of and whats going to like push him to the point of exhaustion and to protect himself as well another example that ive always thought about is when i was at microsoft we had like a big training for our organization of 100 people or something and this guy was kind of leading this workshop a dayong workshop where he was on stage and he was leading us through activities and he was telling jokes and blah blah blah and he was one of the best speakers ive ever seen and he went through this whole thing of like like no im im super introverted when i get on stage i take on a persona that is not me and im able to flip that switch and kind of disassociate who i really am with who i am on stage so that i can do this job and so theres a couple different perspectives i can share with people i think one is kind of the tough love perspective like i understand the things im saying may be more difficult for you than they are for me totally understand that youre a different person different personality different things drain you in different ways totally understand lets accept that lets acknowledge that but lets also acknowledge that like hey if this is something youre serious about there are some things that you have to do that are going to make you uncomfortable and theres a a really cliche saying of like do things that make you uncomfortable and i think thats really stupid what i think is like you should do things that make you uncomfortable because you know they provide value for the thing that you want to accomplish and having like reaching out coldly asking to talk to people that may be awkward lets not pretend its not it may be a challenge lets not pretend its not lets acknowledge that but also just know those are the types of things especially in where we are right now that youre going to have to do to give yourself the best opportunity to get to that milestone which is a next role its a first role as a developer its a first role in tech its a salary that youve never had before its time off in vacation that youve never had before its the ability to prioritize work life balance that youve had before like remember what the longterm goal is and realize like even though doing some of the things that im talking about that other people will tell you they may be a challenge but they are a challenge thats worth it if you can get to that end goal that youre looking for 100 im like taking so many notes here because i i think that you really just encapsulated why its a struggle and like why so many people do persist in learning the code like i always tell people if you want a career where you can potentially you know have some degree of control in your life the boss is not calling you in to work the drivethru at 2 am like i used to get called in taco bell where its like till am so sometimes like somebody gets sick and youre like all right im going to go deal with all the stoners in the drivethru for like two hours right for like five five bucks an hour which is what i was paid back then uh in the in the late 90s when i was doing that uh you know like if you want to actually have agency in your life and if you want to be able to go in and have like negotiating power when youre talking with a hiring manager or the ability to switch companies fluidly and not feel all that fear there is a great deal of investment upfront and its investment in your career and in your skills that doesnt immediately have any payoff like what is the benefit of getting halfway to being a professional developer well you have a lot of cool stuff that you can do and you have like cool hobby and you probably expanded your mind in all kinds of ways that you wouldnt have had you not tried to learn to code and learn data structures algorithms computer science concepts things like that but the real prize at the end of the rainbow the real pot of gold maybe thats a bad analogy because i think in theory like theres not actually a a pot of gold at the end of rainbows like i havent ever like followed a rainbow all the way to the end of it no im just joking im pretty sure thats not physically possible that but um but like for a lot of people that pot of gold is you know why they even got into it right like they dont really care that much about programming a technology they may not even care that much about rebuilding their mind to be able to mimic that of a computer because you have to kind of mimic a computer because youre communicating with computers thats what programming is its telling a computer what to do in terms that it can understand there are a lot of people out there who just want to go out and get a highpaying job and be able to um you know switch jobs if their if their boss is harassing them or switch jobs if they uh their boss suddenly is like hey youve got to come back into the office you got to move halfway across the country you know to our to our hq uh because we sp spent a bunch of money on this real estate and were not using it for anything right um you know you you want to be able to have some degree of control and agency in your life right and and like frankly money gives you a lot of optionality because youre not necessarily like living paycheck to paycheck and youre like a car breakdown away from going into credit card debt right um what would you say to people who dont really care that much about the technology but do want to have that lifestyle that that freedom associated with working as a developer yeah i think i think thats a great question um i think theres theres been this conversation in the community and kind of a debate about the idea of passion like should you should you be passionate um or should you be required to be passionate and i think a lot of people say no because they interpret somebody looking to hire someone thats passionate as someone thats going to work 60 70 80 hours a week like theyre going to put in extra work because theyre passionate and that aside like if thats a perspective thats something i would want to shy away from i wouldnt want someone to hire me because they want me to work 80 hours a week work life balance is incredibly important for me but i think i think passion and excitement about what im doing is very important for me in my life and that is not at a sacrifice of money because i also want to make good money and i also want to have vacation and work life balance and those sort of things i think its just something that goes along with that and so the idea of like someone getting into tech because they want to make good money like theres other reasons too like overall comp and and all the things that you said but if we just look at um good money theres nothing inherently wrong with that just for me to fill the most fulf build i want that to also be associated with something im excited about and the cool thing about i i would say not just programming but like being in tech is i think its its more and more reasonable to combine those things like theres more and more opportunities to find something specific that you actually enjoy and get excited about that also makes really good money and thats just for me like i dont want to wake up every day its not worth the sacrifice to make more money and do something that i hate i want to make still good money and maybe a little bit less but still really good money to do something that i also enjoy because i i think the overall balance of those two is what im looking for but getting into like again just broadly tech is such a game cher for people especially like if if you havent been able to make near the amount of money if you havent seen a modern work culture if you havent seen like respected time off just uh you know like money i think is the easy thing i think for me uh kind of the respect the career opportunities like after you get your foot in the door theres kind of no limit to what you can do and where you can go um again work life talents vacation all the things that come along with it i think especially if you find the right place are uh just just amazing and i i share this story a lot my wife had worked in hospitality for years and i think she she was always really good at what she did she was always respected for what she did but its just very different culturally and uh so she ended up moving to oiro which is we over laughed at alero for two months and shes still there doing events and sponsorships but um she now i mean makes two or three times what she ever made in her career in the past and has a limited vacation gets to travel across the world has a team that she loves working with and its just amazing i think shes the perfect example for someone who like was super talented did a really good job was respected like reasonably for the culture and environment she was in but that level of of respect and and what that means for her now is just completely different and that nothing makes me happier than for her to be in a position where she feels proud of what she does respected for what she does well compensated for what she does and i think thats the kind of opportunity thats out there for anyone thats looking to get into yeah and and i will say like there are a lot of kind of like hills that you can climb and theres this thing this notion of like a hill climbing algorithm and you may have reached like a local maxima right where youre like on top of a hill but if you can look at and you can see higher hills its a lot of work to go down the hill and climb new hill like im sure it wasnt easy for your wife to transition from working in just like more broad hospitality to working doing events at a tech company but uh you know it sounds like she did go down the hill and she figured out a way to climb up a much higher hill and now shes up there and i think that a lot of people uh certainly some people who are listening to this who feel like theyre doing all right you can always do better but a lot of times it takes going down and it takes the notion of like becoming a beginner again in some aspect or or you know rebuilding your network in a different industry or something like that and that can be daunting uh but from what like all the people ive talked to its almost always worth it like very worst case scenario like when i when i was getting when i was learning the code i was already working as a school director so and you know i been to grad school and like i was coming from a position of relative privilege in terms of just having a broad array of knowledge worker type jobs i could do and i knew that i knew i could always kind of go back to directing schools if i scrubbed out if i just wasnt like good enough at coding uh and to some extent that kind of handicapped me a little bit uh early on because i was like you know im already good at this i would tell myself oh im really good at speaking chinese im really good at like you know running running a school im really good at doing paperwork and like managing a team of teachers and stuff like that like i can always go back to that uh and to some extent that like that did make me feel like i was um you know that it wasnt necessary for me to really perform with this and and that this was just like some kind of like crazy uh ideal like this this was a was was a good term for it this was kind of like a romp this was like uh a spous journey into code and i was going to come around and all all my family would be relieved that i went back into the respectful job of you know running a school but uh youre if youre listening to this you may have some skill set you may already be thinking like well im doing all right here uh but you know i think i think your wife is a good example of of theres always a higher hill that you can climb if you look around and if youre willing to put in the time and energy uh so i i hope you all take to heart what james is saying here because for me like it totally rings true like i think there there are always plateaus everybody has plateaus in their life i could have in theory just stay taco bell there was a guy that worked at taco bell named duke who was like really old and and haggard and hes probably about the same age that i am now but he looked like he was like 70 or something and he just building burritos for like 20 plus years and uh and dealing with like you know stone customers and stuff like that and you know like that is a local maxima like like i might have been a promoted the store manager or something eventually right like he was he was like a you know store manager and stuff but just i encourage you all however uh comfortable you may be in your position assuming youre comfortable a lot of people listening to this probably arent comfortable at all a lot of people maybe trying to figure out how theyre going to pay rent next month you know know or or a lot of people you know may be sleeping in their cars i slept in my car for like a year when i left when i dropped out of high school and just like you know was spent all my days at the library and stuff like that and and i wasnt sure what the future held i wasnt even sure if i had a future but uh there is always a hill somewhere that is probably within v visual range that you can see like hey if i climbed up to that hill i would be higher like lets go try to climb that hill and then when you get to higher you see the other high points and and its just hills all the way out right theres always a higher point that you can reach right absolutely and i think the the this is one of the number one pieces of career advice i have for people is to do your research and so if you if you kind of think about what you just said of like oh maybe there is a hill that people have seen or not the reality is like youre probably not going to see that hill if you dont put some intentional effort into finding it and and what that means in this scenario is having those conversations with people like if im throwing out random numbers this is doesnt mean anything but if if you make 40000 a year and you feel pretty comfortable and then all of a sudden at a dinner party you meet somebody whos a developer and they make 150000 a year you may now be interested in what its like to be a developer versus the job that youre in whatever that is and then and then the way that escalates is then you have the deeper conversation to find out like well how long have you been in your career um what did you do to get there what did that look like what did a first job look like and as you start to do your research you can find out out what reasonable hills there are to climb and what reasonable plateaus are at different stages and then how to potentially go from from one to the other but i think you have to you have to spend some time really kind of looking and asking questions having conversation doing your research and figuring out what those opportunities are because you can and again i go back to my wife like super super talented did a great job but just in the industry she was in just had this this cap of what she was capable of of being compensated and and all these things and so i ive been really fortunate i think in my career and and life of being around people that are super super talented and super super smart and and super motivated and i i go back to like my best friend through high school still my best friend today um this is annoying but hes one of the smartest people ive ever known he his backup school was my like dream school and he got accepted into every ivy league school just the smartest person ive ever met and and that can be really frustrating for me at times but also i just see him do things that i never would have thought of as possible and when i worked at microsoft especially fresh out of college and in my first job professional job i was working with startups and students from other universities and just developers in the community and seeing the things they were doing i never imagined that those things were possible but after you start to see them as a reality as a possibility for someone else you start to kind of wonder what is that what does that potential look like for me and then more strategically what sort of research what sort of conversations what sort of questions can i ask to figure out how do i get there yeah 100 and one of the things that uh i think theres a lot of negativity out there a lot of people are going to potentially be watching this and saying like oh so pull yourself up by your bootstraps is what youre saying like like just uh thats a frequent comment that uh people will leave on on these podcasts for example uh because a lot of people uh have its easy for you and i to say from this position of relative success uh like youll make it uh but im here to say you wont necessarily make it not everybodys going to make it a lot of people arent going to make it theyre going to scrub out uh and i just as easily could have scrubbed out i quit programming several times uh right everybody probably quits at some point gets frustrated they cant get it and they just take a few days off and then eventually that like cooler heads prevail and maybe they come back maybe they dont maybe theyre just like oh im going to go take this real estate you know realtor license or something and go that route or um one of the many other careers that you can do other than software development uh but um like there is a lot of negative it out there and a lot of people are probably hearing uh things like its doomed its over you know theres like ai is just going to take all our jobs uh what would you say to somebody who is kind of like a a developer doomer if you will and they they think that like now the industry is over and theres theres no way in yeah i mean i i definitely dont agree with the idea of the industry is over and theres nowh no way in i think the reality is its more difficult to to break in than it was 5 years ago i think we should all be honest about that and i again we go back to layoffs like when you hear about layoffs of big companies happening every month that means theres that many more people already in their careers that are looking for their next role as well so the competition gets tighter salaries go down like i im making less than i made in my fulltime roll at planet scale two years two and a half years ago a little bit less and that was an expectation that just doing my research i had and i expected because thats just how it is its like the the the idea of doom no i dont i dont think were out of jobs i dont think ai is taking jobs like were using ai all the time theres this interesting i think its called devons paradox they give a talk about like the impact on um the ai is having on developers developer expi de ai being a tool that was you know deceptively good at uh doing basic quests right like like they raled that ultimately wasnt nearly as good as the marketing uh said and they used a lot of trickery uh but but i just want to fill people in what devon is devon ai is was i dont know it was some effort to essentially replace uh sell this tool to a company like hey you dont need as many developers look this will this will be your junior developer and all that stuff uh so please go on i just wanted to give people some context in what devon is yeah thats thats actually great context i actually mi misspoke because what i was referring to is jeevans paradox which is obviously sounds somewh but but the idea is like people people look at ai and they say like okay if ai can do these basic things way faster than me the fear is like i get replaced right for those things but but jeevans paradox is the idea that like okay if ai can do these things for us well then then were now capable of doing so much more maybe now we have time to tackle problems that we didnt have time to tackle before because we had to do some of the things that now ai takes on for us so i think you can look at it in two ways you can be fearful of it taking my job and i really dont think that thats been the case i think its been a tool that developers have adopted and adapted to using and i think theyre growing more and more popular every day but i dont think theyre replacing developers but theres the jevans paradox which is li,-0.09064420312643051 -0.010791718028485775 0.020904427394270897 -0.021132398396730423
